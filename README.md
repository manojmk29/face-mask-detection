FACE MASK DETECTION

Perhaps one of the most striking lifestyle changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is the mandatory use of face masks in grocery stores, restaurants and other public places. Wearing a mask, especially when in close proximity to others, is imperative to slowing the spread of COVID-19. Scientists have proven that masking lowers COVID-19 cases.
But we are finding people in public who are not wearing their mask properly. This decreases the effectiveness of masking and increases the wearerâ€™s risk of catching and spreading the disease.

OBJECTIVE: Create a real-time face mask detector to check whether a person in wearing a mask properly or not.

IN THE PROJECT:
	Convolutional neural networks is used to train the model. For real-time detection, open-cv is used.

FUTURE SCOPE:
	This model can be implemented in cameras in public places. Already this technology has been put to use and are in the beginning stages. This can be developed in to a software which would give warning buzzers when someone is found without a mask or not following social distancing. 

STEPS TO USE : 
    Just run the code and you are good to go.
    Also the file 'hyper_model2.h5' which is the model trained by is attached in the repository. Just download and load the model to save computation and time! Cheers!
